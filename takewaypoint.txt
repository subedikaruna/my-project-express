   frontend request backend

   url=localhost:8000/trainees/123?name=karuna & age=30&address=hetauda
   url=route?query
   route=baseUrl+route params


   one request must have one response
   middleware:
      function which has request,res,next are middleware
      next()is used to trigger another middleware

       two types of middleware based on error:
      normal middleware=(req,res,next)=>{} to trigger another middleware next() is used
      normal middleware=(err,req,res,next)=>{} to trigger another middleware next(data) is used

      two types of middlewrae based on location:
      route middleware=>defined in route
      application middleware=>defined in index.js (or main file)

      //mongodb database


      we have to define structure of datadefine array(model)
      define array(model)
      define object
      define object(schema)

      sequence:
      schema
      model 
      controller
      router
      index

      In searching type doesnot matter
